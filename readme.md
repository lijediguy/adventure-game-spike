# Adventure Game Spike

This is just me messing around with Phaser.


#### Thanks
Thanks to the team at [Phaser](http://phaser.io).
Thanks to [Spritedatabase.net](http://spritedatabase.net/file/8705) and Rogultgot for the ripped Link sprites, and Nintendo of course for creating arguably the best game of the 1990s.

# Adventure Game Spike

This is just me messing around with Phaser.

## To run

  * Run `npm install`
  * Compile the TypeScript: `tsc -p .` (or via IDE).
  * Run `node server.js` in the root of the project.
  * Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/index.html .

#### Thanks
  * Thanks to the team at [Phaser](http://phaser.io).
  * Thanks to [Spritedatabase.net](http://spritedatabase.net/file/8705) and Rogultgot for the ripped Link sprites, and Nintendo of course for creating arguably the best game of the 1990s.
